# Adonis App Development

This is the development repository of Adonis application. It is created to have integeration tests for the final application.

## Setting up

Tests are writting in [zombieJs](http://zombie.js.org) and are executed using [ava](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava). Make sure not to add unit tests inside this project. The idea behind testing the app layout is to have end-to-end tests.

1. npm install
2. npm test
